# SICXE-Assembler
 Just a simple SIC/XE Assembler that generates object code and HTE records.

# Warning!
 I created this project for my Systems Programming class. My academic projects are usually very messy and inefficient since I worked on them during the early semesters; You might find a function with ten parameters, creepy variable names, etc...! So as always take care while diving into the code!
